## Technologies

This server is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js** (runtime environment)
- **Express** (web framework)
- **Mongoose** (database, accessed via Mongoose)
- **bcryptjs** (for hashing passwords)
- **jsonwebtoken** (for creating JWT tokens)
- **dotenv** (for environment variable management)

## Installation

To set up the server locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AbdullahAlMaksud/Nihonify_Server.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Nihonify_Server
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables (see the `.env` section below).



## Setup

Before running the server, make sure you have the following:

- **MongoDB Cluster**: You need a MongoDB database. You can use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud solution or a local MongoDB server.
  
- **JWT Secret**: A secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

### .env Example

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

```env
PORT=7001
CONNECTION_STRING=<your-mongodb-uri>
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
```

Replace `<your-mongodb-uri>` with your MongoDB connection string and `<your-secret-key>` with a secure key for JWT signing.
